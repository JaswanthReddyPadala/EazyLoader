## Submitting Contributionsüë©‚Äçüíªüë®‚Äçüíª

This project requires the following tools:
 * Python - The programming language used by Flask.
 * Pipenv or Virtualenv - Tools used for managing virtual environments.

To get started, install Python from [here](https://python.org) on your local computer if you don't have already.

Below you will find the process and workflow used to review and merge your changes.

**Step 0 : Find an issue**

- Take a look at the Existing Issues or create your **own** Issues!
- Wait for the Issue to be assigned to you after which you can start working on it.
- Note : Every change in this project should/must have an associated issue.

**Step 1. Fork the repository from [here](https://github.com/ashutoshkrris/EazyLoader/fork).**

![fork](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ashutoshkrris/EazyLoader/main/demo/fork.png)

**Step 2. Clone the forked repository into a fresh folder**

```
$ git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/EazyLoader.git
$ cd EazyLoader
```
> Note : Replace `<your-username>` with your own username in the above command.

- Keep a reference to the original project in `upstream` remote. 
    ```bash
    git remote add upstream https://github.com/ashutoshkrris/EazyLoader
    ```

- If you have already forked the project, update your copy before working.
    ```bash
    git remote update
    git checkout main
    git rebase upstream/main
    ```  

**Step 3. Create a Virtual Environment and install Dependencies.**

Create a new Virtual Environment for the project and activate it. If you don't have the `virtualenv` command yet, you can find installation [instructions here](https://virtualenv.readthedocs.io/en/latest/). Learn more about [Virtual Environments](http://flask.pocoo.org/docs/1.0/installation/#virtual-environments).

- Using virtualenv :
    ```bash
    $ virtualenv venv
    $ source venv/bin/activate
    ```

- Using pipenv : 
    ```bash
    $ pipenv shell
    ```

Next, we need to install the project dependencies, which are listed in `requirements.txt` or `Pipfile`.

- Using virtualenv :
    ```bash
    $ pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

- Using pipenv : 
    ```bash
    $ pipenv install
    ```

**Step 4: Update environment variables and run the Server.**

Create a new file named `.env` and update the new file with the following data. It should look similar to this:

```
SECRET_KEY=fdkjshfhjsdfdskfdsfdcbsjdkfdsdf
DEBUG=True
APP_SETTINGS=config.DevelopmentConfig
```

Learn more about the Environment Variables [here](https://iread.ga/posts/49/do-you-really-need-environment-variables-in-python).

**Step 5: Install required Webdriver**

To use this feature, you need to have Google Chrome and [Chrrome Webdriver](https://chromedriver.chromium.org/downloads) added in your ```$PATH``` in ```/bin``` folder. Download and install the version compatible with your google chrome version(the same version). You may have to update this from time to time.


You may also use the Firefox browser and [gekodriver](https://github.com/mozilla/geckodriver/releases/) alternatively.


**Note**: use may use anyone of the above options, the web application will run perfectly fine in either browser without any issue.


Now we're ready to start our server which is as simple as:

```
(venv) $ python main.py
```

Open http://127.0.0.1:5000 to view it in your browser.

The app will automatically reload if you make changes to the code.
You will see the build errors and warnings in the console.


**Step 6 : Work on the issue assigned**

- Work on the issue(s) assigned to you.
- Add all the files/folders needed.
- After you've made changes or made your contribution to the project add changes to the branch you've just created by:

    ```bash  
    # To add all new files to your branch
    git add .  

    # To add only a few files to Branch_Name
    git add <some files>
    ```

**Step 7 : Commit**

- To commit give a descriptive message for the convenience of reviewer by:

    ```bash
    # This message get associated with all files you have changed  
    git commit -m "message"  
    ```

- **NOTE**: A PR should have only one commit. Multiple commits should be squashed.

**Step 8 : Work Remotely**

- Now you are ready to your work to the remote repository.
- When your work is ready and complies with the project conventions, upload your changes to your fork:

    ```bash  
    # To push your work to your remote repository
    git push -u origin <branch-name>
    ```

**Step 9 : Pull Request**

- Go to your repository in browser and click on compare and pull requests. Then add a title and description to your pull request that explains your contribution.
- Voila! Your Pull Request has been submitted and will be reviewed by the moderators and merged.ü•≥
